# CyberCat
## Status: Alpha Testing
CyberCat aims to connect all forms of APIs into one interface and do cross correlations to present the most accurate picture of an IP/DOMAIN/HASH. The base of this project was built off using FREE API keys from providers. Thus, some features were not added due to costs.

The applicaion features smart logic which will determine if input is an IP, DOMAIN or HASH and run the appropriate API calls. 

The finished project will come as a deployable container and a quick setup guide to input API keys.
