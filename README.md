# CyberCat
CyberCat aims to connect all forms of APIs into one interface and do cross correlations to present the most accurate picture of an IP/DOMAIN/HASH. The base of this project was built off using FREE API keys from providers. Thus some features were not added due to costs.

The finished project will come as a deployable container and a quick setup guide to input API keys.
